# MachineLearning

Stanford University's (Coursera) Machine Learning course weekly assigments implemented in java (originally coded in Octave).
Visualization added where it was possible. Task texts included in the java files.
All class (java) files have main function so you only need to download the one you are interested in plus the library/ies it uses (below).

l.(com.mkis.assignments.gradientdescentandnormalequation)
- Linear Regression with gradient descent with 1 variable both vectorized and non vectorized solution (visualization with JfreeChart, using Apache Commons Math)
- Linear Regression with gradient descent with multiple variables and feature scaling (using Apache Commons Math)

2.(com.mkis.assignments.logisticregression)
- Binary Logistic Regression (linear) with gradient descent applying mean normalization (visualization with JfreeChart)
- Binary Logistic Regression (polynomial) with gradient descent applying regularization and feature mapping (visualization with JfreeChart)

3.(com.mkis.assignments.multiclassclassification)
- Multiclass: One vs all method using logistic regression with gradient descent applying mean normalization
- Naive Bayes algorithm used on the same task (noticable speed difference!) (using WEKA API)
