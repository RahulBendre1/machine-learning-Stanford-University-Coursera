# MachineLearning

Stanford University's (Coursera) Machine Learning course weekly assigments implemented in java (originally coded in Octave).
Visualization added where it was possible.
All class (java) files have main function so you only need to download the one you interested in plus library it uses (below).

l: 
- Linear Regression with gradient descent with 1 variable both vectorized and non vectorized solution (Visualization with JfreeChart, using Apache Commons Math)
- Linear Regression with gradient descent with multiple variables and feature scaling (using Apache Commons Math)

2:
- Binary Logistic Regression (linear) (Visualization with JfreeChart)
- Binary Logistic Regression (polynomial) with regularization and feature mapping (Visualization with JfreeChart)
